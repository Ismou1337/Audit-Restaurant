# File Comparison Checklist

## Files in Your Current Cloudways (from screenshot)

### ✅ Files that exist in GitHub structure:
- `admin.php` → `src/admin.php` ✓
- `config.php` → `src/config.php` ✓  
- `EmailService.php` → `src/EmailService.php` ✓
- `index.php` → `src/index.php` ✓
- `ImageOptimizer.php` → `src/classes/ImageOptimizer.php` ✓
- `traitement-simple.php` → `src/traitement-simple.php` ✓
- `photos/` → `photos/` ✓

### ⚠️ Files that need attention:
- `audits.json` → **Data file** - keep on server, add to .gitignore
- `enregistrer-audit.php` → **Compare with traitement-simple.php**
- `export-excel.php` → **Missing from GitHub** - may need to add
- `login-admin.php` → **Check if functionality is in admin.php**
- `logout-admin.php` → **Check if functionality is in admin.php**
- `maintenance-photos.php` → **Missing from GitHub** - may need to add
- `script.php` → **Check what this does** - may need to merge
- `smtp-config.php` → **May be merged into EmailService.php**
- `phpmailer/` → **Should be managed by Composer**

## Action Items for Safe Migration:

### 1. First, analyze these missing files:
Create these files by examining your Cloudways versions:

```bash
# In your duplicated Cloudways app, check what these files do:
- export-excel.php
- login-admin.php  
- logout-admin.php
- maintenance-photos.php
- script.php
- enregistrer-audit.php
```

### 2. Update .gitignore for data files:
```
# Add to .gitignore
audits.json
*.json
backup/
```

### 3. Compare key files:
- **enregistrer-audit.php vs traitement-simple.php** - are they the same?
- **login/logout functionality** - is it in admin.php?
- **maintenance-photos.php** - what does this do?

### 4. Dependencies check:
- **phpmailer/** folder should become `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`
- Check if all includes/requires work with new paths

## Next Steps:

1. **Duplicate your Cloudways app**
2. **Download the files listed above from Cloudways**
3. **Compare them with our GitHub structure**
4. **Add missing files to GitHub repo**
5. **Test everything in the duplicate**
6. **Only then migrate the main app**

Would you like me to help you analyze any specific file once you have access to it?
